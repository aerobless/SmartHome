### Google Home
I use Google Home to have voice controls for all my devices and as a digital assistant. Devices relevant for voice controls are exposed to Google Assistant via the Nabu Casa integration.
In my apartment I've deployed 5 Google Home devices to reach 100% coverage of voice recognition in all rooms. In addition to voice control they also serve as smart speakers for playing music or notifications.

Some of the commands I use most often:

Okay Google ...

+ \[**open**/close\] the blinds
+ turn \[**all**/the bedroom/the living room\] lights \[**on**/off\]
+ play \[**music**/radio\] \[**...**/on everywhere\]
+ add \[item\] to the shopping list
+ what's the temperature \[**inside**/outside\]?
+ turn off the tv

| Google Home | The original Google Home. Has pretty good sound quality from multiple speakers. I have one placed near the computer desk and I use it to listen to music. | 1         |
| Google Home Mini | This a small version of a Google Home, it has only one speaker.  I have one in the bathroom, bedroom and loggia. They're decent enough to listen to music ocasionally. | 3                             |
| Google Nest Hub | This one is also a smart display. It can show receipts, timers, maps, youtube videos and more. I have one in the kitchen, it's ideal for cooking. Also nice to see the weather forecast for the whole week. It has a touch screen but I operate it only by voice 95% of the time. | 1         |
