Most of my automations are built in [Node-RED](/software/node-red/). Even though Home Assistant native automations have come a long way, there's still a few advantages that you only get with Node-RED. You can read more about it [here](/software/node-red/#why-use-node-red-over-the-home-assistant-built-in-automation-features).

If you're new to Node-RED have a look at my new [Getting Started with Node-RED](/automations/getting-started-with-node-red/) guide. It covers everything from installation to setting up your first automation.
