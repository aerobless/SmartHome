# Welcome

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my Smart Home documentation!

I've set up this page to document my own setup and also to share some of my findings, configuration hints and automations. Although there's a vast community of fellow Smart Home enthusiasts it can still be hard to get started. I'm trying to make this a bit easier with this site.

If you've got any input, have questions or otherwise get stuck feel free to leave a comment ðŸ˜„ or hit me up on twitter [@eletiy](https://twitter.com/eletiy)
