Computers \u00b6 Intel NUC Baby Canyon NUC7i3BNH \u00b6 The brains of my whole Smart Home setup. It's sporting a Intel i3-7100U CPU clocking 2.4 GHz, 2x 8GB DDR-4 Ram and an Intel 545 256GB SSD. As for software it's running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Docker and most importantly Home Assistant. Raspberry PI Zero \u00b6 Just a Raspberry Pi Zero running a headless Raspbian image. I use it as a BLE to MQTT gateway for the Xiaomi Flower Care sensors in my loggia. When triggered it will poll all the Flower Care sensors and forward their values over MQTT. Sensors \u00b6 Xiaomi \u00b6 I have a lot of Xiaomi sensors. They're all paired to the Dresden Elektronik ConBee ZigBee stick Name Description Sensors Communication Aqara Shock Sensor Detects movement Vibration, Temperature ZigBee Aqara Temperature Sensor Reports temperature, humidity etc. Temperature, Humidity, Atmospheric Pressure ZigBee Xiaomi Flower Care Reports soil status. Water level, temperature, fertilizer BLE Aqara Door Sensor Detects door open/closed open/close ZigBee Philips Hue \u00b6 Withings Sleep \u00b6 It's main purpose is to record my sleep patterns and store them in Apple Health. However as an added benefit I can use it detect when the bed is occupied and e.g. automatically turn off lights. Netatmo Weatherstation \u00b6 One of the first devices I bought for my smart home. It consists of a indoor and outdoor weather station. Sadly the outdoor one has died after a few years.. but the indoor one is still going strong. Apart from the temperature it also reports the Carbon Dioxide levels which none of my other sensors do. Power Switches \u00b6 Shelly \u00b6 Shelly's are tiny power switches that I've placed behind the actual light switches of my apartment. I mainly use them to detach the event of clicking a light-switch and turning the power of the light bulbs on/off. Since I use smart light bulbs (Philips Hue), the light bulbs need to be powered on all the time, otherwise they can't be controlled via Home Assistant, Google Home etc. This is where the Shellys come in real handy. They connect to Home Assistant via MQTT over WiFi and they can be configured in a way that pressing the actual light switch will simply send an MQTT event but not actually turn of the power of the light bulbs. Home Assistant can then decide what to do with the button press event. In some cases I turn on/off the lights, but in other cases I've re-used the light switch to do other things. Such as change light scene or turn on the radio. Shelly 1PM \u00b6 This shelly switches on power line / button. It also measure the power consumed. Shelly 1PM \u00b6 This shelly switches two power lines / buttons. It also measures the power consumed. It could also be used to control electric blinds, but I don't use it for that. MyStrom Switch \u00b6 I have a bunch of MyStrom smart switches connected to all sorts of devices. I use them to control the connected devices, but also for automations. For example I use two of them to measure the power consumption of the washer & dryer. That data is then used to send a notification when the washer or dryer has finished and it's time to take out the clothes. Voice Assistants & Smart Display \u00b6 Google Home \u00b6 I use Google Home to have voice controls for all my devices and as a digital assistant. Devices relevant for voice controls are exposed to Google Assistant via the Nabu Casa integration. In my apartment I've deployed 5 Google Home devices to reach 100% coverage of voice recognition in all rooms. In addition to voice control they also serve as smart speakers for playing music or notifications. Some of the commands I use most often: Okay Google ... [ open /close] the blinds turn [ all /the bedroom/the living room] lights [ on /off] play [ music /radio] [ ... /on everywhere] add [item] to the shopping list what's the temperature [ inside /outside]? turn off the tv Device Description Count Google Home The original Google Home. Has pretty good sound quality from multiple speakers. I have one placed near the computer desk and I use it to listen to music. 1 Google Home Mini This a small version of a Google Home, it has only one speaker. I have one in the bathroom, bedroom and loggia. They're decent enough to listen to music ocasionally. 3 Google Nest Hub This one is also a smart display. It can show receipts, timers, maps, youtube videos and more. I have one in the kitchen, it's ideal for cooking. Also nice to see the weather forecast for the whole week. It has a touch screen but I operate it only by voice 95% of the time. 1 Lights \u00b6 Philips Hue \u00b6 I use mostly Philips Hue lightbulbs. Philips Filament Nanoleaf Aurora \u00b6 A smart light consisting of triangle shaped LED panels. The panels can be arranged in any pattern desired. It can also be animated with or without music. The Nanoleaf connects to Home Assistant over WiFi. Wireless Network Hubs \u00b6 Infrared \u00b6 Logitech Harmony Hub \u00b6 Used to control TV, external speakers and air conditioner. ZigBee \u00b6 Dresden Elektronik ConBee Stick \u00b6 I use a Dresden Elektronik ConBee stick as ZigBee gateway for most of my ZigBee devices. I'd like to use it exclusively, however I've been having some trouble with the new Bluetooth-enabled Philips Hue bulbs. So those few new gen Philips Hue bulbs are connected to a normal Hue Hub. The ConBee stick is plugged directly into the Intel Nuc running Home Assistant. Philips Hue Hub v2 \u00b6 I use this hub only to connect to newer Philips Hue bulbs that don't yet work with the ConBee ZigBee stick. I'd prefer to not use this hub because it is only connected to Home Assistant via Polling, this makes it slower then the ZigBee stick. It also doesn't support the Xiaomi ZigBee sensors and those sensors benefit from having powered devices nearby. So I try to have all ZigBee devices in the mesh connected to the Dresden Elektronik ConBee Stick. WiFi & Ethernet \u00b6 FRITZ!Box 5490 \u00b6 The router recommended by my internet provider (Init 7). This is the fiber version. It works very well and I'm quite happy. It's easy to set static IPs in the local network and port forwarding works well. I don't use the WiFi feature. D-Link DGS-105 \u00b6 Google Wifi \u00b6 I use this only because it's made by Google and looks quite nice. TV & Entertainment \u00b6 Samsung QE65Q7F \u00b6 A smart tv. It connects to the internet over Ethernet or WiFi. It has some Web APIs but they're quite restricted and not fully finished.. e.g. you can switch between tv mode and the first hdmi source but not others.. so I've ended up automating it over IR commands sent via a Logitech Harmony Hub. Other then the bad API it's a good tv. It has apps for all the major streaming providers and it can also play 4k video from a computer or network share. Sony PS4 Pro \u00b6 A game console. It can be controlled by Home Assistant via ethernet/WiFi. Apple TV 4K 32GB \u00b6 I originally bought this as a way to expose Apple Homekit for remote access. However I've since stopped using Homekit almost entirely. It still sees occasional use a airplay display. Nvidia Shield TV \u00b6 I originally bought this because I thought Android TV was cool. I rarely use it. It serves as a Chromecast occasionally.. but that's really all there is to it. Locks \u00b6 Nello One \u00b6 The Nello One is a interesting device. It's installed as a middle man between the buildings intercom/door opener system. It allows me to open the apartment buildings main door from my phone instead of with a key. The way it does this is by emulating a button press (door open) on the intercom device. NFC \u00b6 NFC Tags \u00b6 Blinds \u00b6 KNX Controller \u00b6 KNX IP Bridge \u00b6 Other Smart Devices \u00b6 Kibernetik Air Conditioner \u00b6 A simple AC device. Communicates over IR. iRobot Roomba 980 \u00b6 Smart vacuum robot that communicates over WiFi. It's actually running Linux and you can connect to it via SSH. Pretty dope, no? :D Oral-B Elektro Genius 10100S \u00b6 Smart toothbrush that communicates over BLE.","title":"Hardware"},{"location":"hardware/#computers","text":"","title":"Computers"},{"location":"hardware/#intel-nuc-baby-canyon-nuc7i3bnh","text":"The brains of my whole Smart Home setup.

Screens \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 This screen I use 90% of the time. Most devices are controllable from the mini map \"Apartment Status\".

It's not strictly limited to only Smart Home stuff since it's hard to draw a clear line. Home Automation \u00b6 Home Assistant \u00b6 Home Assistant is the core of my smart home setup. It's an open source home automation software written in Python that runs locally on a computer as small as a Raspberry Pi or as powerful as the user desires. At the time of me writing this it supports over 1500 integrations with various smart home devices & services. It is actively developed and has a regular release cycle of 3 weeks. Updates are frequent and of good quality. I'm running my Home Assistant instance on a Intel NUC in supervised mode. This means I provide my own OS of choice (Ubuntu) and Home Assistant runs a supervisor software on top that manages the docker containers used by itself and addons. Node-RED \u00b6 Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services. It provides a web-editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using a wide range of nodes. Changes can be deployed with a single-click. Node-RED was originally developed by IBM but has since been contributed to the open source JS Foundation project. I run Node-RED as a addon in Home Assistant and I use it to create & run a ton of simple and complicated automations. Some of my favorite automations are: only starting the cleaning robot when I'm not home, reminding me that the washing machine has finished with a push notification & google home announcement, and operating various lights fully automatically. Visual Studio Code \u00b6 Visual Studio Code is an awesome IDE in it's own right. However I also run it as a Home Assistant Addon in order to edit all those .yaml configuration files. What's especially cool is that it has a full integration with Home Assistant, so there's even autocompletion for all the device entities managed by Home Assistant. Documentation \u00b6 MkDocs \u00b6 This page is made with MkDocs . It's a static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. The source files are written in Markdown and configured with a single .yaml configuration file.
