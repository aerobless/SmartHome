Computers \u00b6 Intel NUC Baby Canyon NUC7i3BNH \u00b6 The brains of my whole Smart Home setup. It's sporting a Intel i3-7100U CPU clocking 2.4 GHz, 2x 8GB DDR-4 Ram and an Intel 545 256GB SSD. As for software it's running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Docker and most importantly Home Assistant. Raspberry PI Zero \u00b6 Just a Raspberry Pi Zero running a headless raspbian image. I use it as a BLE to MQTT gateway for the Xiaomi Flower Care sensors in my loggia. When triggered it will poll all the Flower Care sensors and forward their values over MQTT. Sensors \u00b6 Xiaomi \u00b6 I have a lot of Xiaomi sensors. They're all paired to the Dresden Elektronik ConBee ZigBee stick Name Description Sensors Communication Aqara Shock Sensor Detects movement Vibration, Temperature ZigBee Aqara Temperature Sensor Reports temperature, humidity etc. Temperature, Humidity, Atmospheric Pressure ZigBee Xiaomi Flower Care Reports soil status. Water level, temperature, fertilizer BLE Aqara Door Sensor Detects door open/closed open/close ZigBee Philips Hue \u00b6 Netatmo Weatherstation \u00b6 Power Switches \u00b6 Shelly \u00b6 MyStrom \u00b6 I have a bunch of MyStrom smart switches connected to all sorts of devices. I use them to control the connected devices, but also for automations. For example I use two of them to measure the power consumption of the washer & dryer. That data is then used to send a notification when the washer or dryer has finished and it's time to take out the clothes. Voice Assistants & Smart Display \u00b6 Google Home \u00b6 Google Home Mini 3x Google Home Google Nest Hub Lights \u00b6 Philips Hue \u00b6 I use mostly Philips Hue lightbulbs. Philips Filament Nanoleaf Aurora \u00b6 Wireless Network Hubs \u00b6 Infrared \u00b6 Logitech Harmony Hub \u00b6 Used to control TV and external speakers. ZigBee \u00b6 Dresden Elektronik ConBee Stick \u00b6 I use a Dreden Elektronik ConBee stick as ZigBee gateway for most of my ZigBee devices. I'd like to use it exclusively, however I've been having some trouble with the new Bluetooth-enabled Philips Hue blubs. So those few new gen Philips Hue blubs are connected to a normal Hue Hub. The ConBee stick is plugged directly into the Intel Nuc running Home Assistant. Philips Hue Hub v2 \u00b6 I use this hub only to connect to newer Philips Hue blubs that don't yet work with the ConBee ZigBee stick. I'd prefer to not use this hub because it is only connected to Home Assistant via Polling, this makes it slower then the ZigBee stick. It also doesn't support the Xiaomi ZigBee sensors and those sensors benefit from having powered devices nearby. So I try to have all ZigBee devices in the mesh connected to the Dresden Elektronik ConBee Stick. WiFi & Ethernet \u00b6 FRITZ!Box 5490 \u00b6 D-Link DGS-105 \u00b6 TV & Entertainment \u00b6 Samsung QE65Q7F \u00b6 Sony PS4 Pro \u00b6 Apple TV 4K 32GB \u00b6 Nvidia Shield TV \u00b6 Locks \u00b6 Nello One \u00b6 NFC \u00b6 NFC Tags \u00b6 Other Smart Devices \u00b6 iRobot Roomba 980 \u00b6 Oral-B Elektro Genius 10100S \u00b6","title":"Hardware"},{"location":"hardware/#computers","text":"","title":"Computers"},{"location":"hardware/#intel-nuc-baby-canyon-nuc7i3bnh","text":"The brains of my whole Smart Home setup.
